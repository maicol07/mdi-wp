# Material Design Icons
Original plugin by: [@braginteractive](https://github.com/braginteractive]

Enables 1000+ Material Design icons within WordPress pages and posts. Icons can be inserted with a shortcode or HTML markup.
A full list of the 1000+ Material Design Icons icons is available: [materialdesignicons.com/](http://materialdesignicons.com/)

## Usage Instructions
To use any of the Material Design icons on your WordPress site you have two options:

### HTML
**Examples**
Bell icon: `<i class="mdi mdi-bell"></i>`

### Shortcode
Don't want to worry about HTML tags?  You can use a shortcode in your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Material Design icon.
The shortcode to use is `[mdi-icon name=X]`, where name=X is the class of the icon you would like to use.

**Examples**
Amazon icon: `[mdi-icon name="amazon"]`

From v0.0.3 you can now add size and color: `[mdi-icon name="amazon" color="red" size="2x"]`

Hex values will work for the color option and the include size values are: lg, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 9x, 10x

## Installation
**Method 1 (easiest)**
Use the WordPress plugin directory: [Material Design Icons Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/material-design-icons/)

**Method 2 (only if first fails for some unknown reason)**
1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use one of the two usage methods (HTML or Shortcode) within the content of your posts or pages.   
4. Use either the HTML or Shortcode methods inside your text widgets.
